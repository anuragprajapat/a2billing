/** cc_paytypes Define rules (texts) for pay/charge types to be used in combos etc.
	id is the text, as seen in cc_texts. This is better than using text, since
		pay_type would be used many times in reports and it has to be both
		matched and translated. Hence an integer field.
	side is an arbitrary enum like:
		1 company to agent
		2 agent to company
		3 charges from agent to customer
		4 bonuses from agent to customer
		5 normal transactions between agent and customer
	preset is a text field so that the php code can automatically select and
		apply one of those charges. eg. 'print-cust-invoice'
