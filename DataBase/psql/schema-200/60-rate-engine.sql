/** We have a customer (cc_card), the current time and trunk status and the
    desired destination (dialstring).
    We must come up with a list of dial information (trunk+dialstring),
    selling prices, buying prices etc.

	_The Algorithm_
    [1. First look at the numplan and detect if the dialstring has international prefix]
    2. Locate the tariffgroup -> retail plan
    3. Locate the selling rate etc. from retail plan
    4. Locate the buying plan(s), buing price
    5. Locate trunks
    6. Filter out a few lines, based on trunks availability etc.
    7. Sort by cost or whatever.
