2. BASIC DESCRIPTION OF THE CALLBACK

	Description of the Callback in 10 steps :
	
		1. The client makes a phone call to one of our access numbers. His Caller ID information 
		must be available from his phone carrier (not blocked).
		
		2. The server sees the incoming call and processes it with the appropriate context (ex. cid-callback)
		
		3. The custom_calling_card context will call the AGI provided with A2Billing (a2billing.php) and uses it in cid-callback mode. 
		
		4. The AGI will check the detected Caller ID and check if itâ€™s an existing client. 
		If that is the case, it will schedule a callback for that client and it will hang up the line.
		
		5. A few seconds later, the server calls the client and use an another context that will let A2Billing know that this is the 
		2nd phase of a callback process.
		
		6. A2Billing will use the number called to lookup various account specific information (account balance, currency settings, and so on).
		
		7. As soon as the client picks up the line, A2Billing will play his remaining balance, and invite him to dial a number
		
		8. The client dials a number
		
		9. A2Billing will tell the maximum time for the call and so on.
