I will prefer we use always the following type
activated INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,



######## NOTE FROM CHRISTEAS : BACKUP DB
********************************************************************
giving apache the right to dump stuff is bad, IMHO.
So, you could have a crontab task backing up the database. 
That task could use a 'a2billing' system user, with the rights to connect to the database.

#### FEATURE : PACKAGES SYSTEM - FREE MINUTES
********************************************************************
Situation :
We need to support a new relation call "FREE MINUTE" under kind of package according to the destination.
We have an example : http://www.blueface.ie/
There is several kind of packages :
- Unlimited UK/Ireland where they can call as much as they want to this destination and pay for the rest.
- 300 minutes free over 20 destinations + unlimited on Uk for instance
- 300 minutes free over 20 destinations
- pay as you go, standard

We have to add in A2Billing this relation... For the unlimited calls we already have the routes at 0 cost.
now we might need to assign the X free minutes relation over YZ destinations.


- 300 minutes free over 20 destinations + unlimited on Uk for instance
the relation unlimited is already defined in the rate-engine through the route with cost=0

we need to add new table :
table cc_package to define the type package & min free. 
CREATE TABLE cc_package_offer (
    id bigserial NOT NULL,
    creationdate timestamp without time zone DEFAULT now(),
    label text NOT NULL,
    packagetype int NOT NULL,
	billingtype int NOT NULL,
	startday int NOT NULL,
	freeminutes int NOT NULL
);
-- packagetype : Free minute + Unlimited ; Free minute ; Unlimited ; Normal
-- billingtype : Monthly ; Weekly 
-- startday : according to billingtype ; if monthly value 1-31 ; if Weekly value 1-7 (Monday to Sunday) 
I guess a field in cc_tariffgroup which will define the relation with cc_package_offer 
and a field in cc_ratecard to define if the rate will take advantage of the package offer (part of X min free)

We have also to think that the offer will be per month (per week, etc..) so we will need to keep the number of free-minutes used by month (period)
and by user/card, Customer have to have the offer for each time period (since the creation date).
Table cc_card_package (id_card, id_package_offer, time_used(secondes) )

CREATE TABLE cc_card_package_offer (
    id 					bigserial NOT NULL,
	id_cc_card 			bigint NOT NULL.
	id_cc_package_offer bigint NOT NULL,
    date_consumption 	timestamp without time zone DEFAULT now(),
	used_secondes 		bigint NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX ind_cc_card_package_offer_id_card ON cc_card_package_offer USING btree (id_cc_card);
CREATE INDEX ind_cc_card_package_offer_id_package_offer ON cc_card_package_offer USING btree (id_package_offer);
CREATE INDEX ind_cc_card_package_offer_date_consumption ON cc_card_package_offer USING btree (date_consumption);

ALTER TABLE cc_tariffgroup 	ADD COLUMN id_cc_package_offer BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE cc_ratecard 	ADD COLUMN freeminute_package_offer INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;


Other Billing difficulty : 
When we reach the limite, we will have part of the call inside the offer (so not billed) and the rest of the minutes should be billed...


CREATE TABLE cc_subscription_fee (
    id 				BIGSERIAL NOT NULL,
    label 			TEXT NOT NULL,	
	fee 			NUMERIC(12,4) NOT NULL,
	status 			INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    numberofrun 	INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

);

#### FEATURE : ROTATION CALLERID IN OUTBOUND CALLS
********************************************************************
Situation: if I want to put a Asterisk box in Romania with a Digium board to terminate Romanian traffic.
But the Romanian PTT will deny all calls if they don't have a Romanian CID. we need a way you can make some 
thing so that every time I send a call to Romania it takes a good Romanian number out of a list of 500 or 1000 CID's.

NEED : Little modification to do in the AGI and on the Admin UI.
We will have to define the group of CallerID according to the destination and so we need a new field in
cc_ratecard -> outbound_cid_group


and 2 new tables :
cc_outbound_cid_group
(id, label, datecreated, blabla...)
cc_outbound_cid_list
(id, outbound_cid_group, cid, datecreated, blabla...)

cc_outbound_cid_group is the group info that will be associate to the destination : destination (cc_ratecard)

In the AGI : if the system found cc_outbound_cid_group defined when running the outbound call, it will take randomly
a CID number in this group and it will be defined before the outbound call.


In the admin site, there is a bit of work also, but basically it will use the standard function from the framework.
OUTBOUND CID
- Create Group
- List Group
- Add OUTBOUND CID
- List OUTBOUND CID

later :
- Import OUTBOUND CID

&browse_style= page number or Letter (A, B, C)
& prefix_select = 32 (only prefix start by 32)
& url_page = http://mysite.com/rates.php

The idea it s to have something very flexible so that users could get
something like this
http://www.voip.com/voip_international.aspx
well more or less :D

I guess we can reuse some page from the customer interface to show ratecard and
transform this to an API and something more flexible on design
well the idea it s to keep something flexible so that anybody can display what
they want from the ratecard.



#### FEATURE
********************************************************************

When the user credit are below the minimum credit to call min_credit 
we might have an option to decide if we jump directly to the voucher IVR menu instead of just disconecting

option in a2billing.conf

#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
BATCH GENERATION OF INVOICE (Phuong)

need a feature that can allow admin to generate the invoice for all the postpaid or 
prepaid account with just one click.

right now, we have to go to Call Report/Invoice, and then select the respective month, 
and then select the card one by one, and then save the html page. And doing that 
repetitively for 100 cards is quite gruesome 

so auto generate invoice (with criteria) and maybe auto mailing, that will be cool

REPORTING AND SUPPORT ALARMS :

   * ALOC (average length of call): Too low or too high.
   * ASR (answer seize ratio): Too low or too high.
maybe if possible :
   * Consecutive Incomplete Calls: Too many.
   
We already have ALOC under the name of ACD in the page "CDR REPORT", we just need a new column for ASR and
rename ACD -> ALOC


ASR = Answer Seizure Ratio
Its calculated by taking the number of sucessfully answered calls and dividing by the total number of calls attempted (seizures). Since busy signals and other rejections by the called number count as call failures, the calculated ASR value can vary depending on user behaviour. 


For "Consecutive Incomplete Calls", we might find a way to display this I open to your suggestion. maybe a report as follow :
Date ; total nb fails ; max of number fail calls succesively ; rate of fails (%)



For the alarm let's build a new table and a new page in CRONT SERVICE.
We need the user to be able to define different kind of alarm, for instance if I want
to monitor a specific trunk and not all
We can have in the table something like :
- period (daily ; monday-sunday ; 01 - 31)
- typealarm (asr, aloc, callfail)
- trunk (all or the ID of the trunk)
- etc...

thoughts to adding timezone to cc_card ? It's great that we've got language and currency so they can view items in their local currency. Why not have option for timezone so the CDR's are listed in their local times instead of where the switch is located?
I borrowed this idea from SER. I can get you their database table they use if you like. It makes it easy for user instead of asking for +/- GMT, has items such as:


#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
Marcel

- invoices: keep an end of the month balance and send automatically invoices at the end of the month using an email template and attaching a html invoice report; fields in the template would include name, last month balance, current month payments, current month per minute charges, DIDs and other charges, etc.

- payment: send payment emails to customers when "Add Payment" is used; send an email out of a template saying something like "thank you for payment of XXX made on YYYY...."; maybe the ability to display the payment history on the customer web site to see if they paid the bill or not 

"Add Payment" do not refill the account, you have to do refill manually.

#### BUG
********************************************************************

1 - When you navigate CDR Report you see all calls from all customers.
When you filter the calls list by cardnumber you're supposed to have a
list with calls from that cardnumber only. That is true, unless you
change the ordering column or navigate to the next results page. If you
do, the filter seems to be ignored by the CDR Report, and you get
listing from all customers again.

	exten => _X.,1,DeadAGI(a2billing.php|1|cid-callback|34) ;last
	parameter is the callback area code
	exten => _X.,2,Hangup
	
	As u see the last parameter is the area code and from instance :
	if I am in Belgium and use a local DID for callback but my server are
	in UK, the system will probably not know that it needs to call me back
	over the prefix 32, that's why is needed.
	So in this case my cell number 0473510969, a2b will be call me as 32473510969.
	That s the meaning of the remaining zero and it makes sense to set a parameter 
	for the leading zero if you are
	already in the local country.

Suggestion from Vahan
	1. First of all I'd suggest to introduce one single yet simple config
	option in a2billing.conf: silent=yes|no that allows to turn off all the
	voice prompts in the case a2billing.php has successfully authenticated
	the caller-id/card number and if the assosiated card number has enough
	credit. Currently you have to disable several announce configs for this.

	2. add an option to filter by first name / last name too in the card picker.

	3. Please first name to the list to as a separate column or merged with
	last name. It's difficult to track people by their lastnames only.
	Areski : I propose more to get rid of lastname and include a new feature to 
	roll over the row and get more info. it will keep up a clear design

	IF YOU ADD A RATE AND NOT AN EDIT => You can also define several in the same time and range, as below:
	32484-32487 -> this would insert 32484, 32485, 32486, 32487

e.) at the form of adding/changing SIP/IAX user there should be a possibilty to erase some parameters. like if there isn't any entry (example in canreinvite) that this also don't will be printed to the sip-config.

So the statments "if ($A2B->agiconfig['debug']>=1) " don't work even the debug is set (i printed out the debug and I've seen it that the entry is correct. Maybe there is a mistake in the $agi->verbose but I don't looked there because it isn't so urgent to fix it.
 
Here is a example (the first line is from me and will printed out, the $A2B->agiconfig['debug'] = 2 but the two verbose don't will be printed to the log_file) :

Petite question: je suis entrain de mettre en place des routes et ai

soit c'est ultra-payant :-( Si je dois autoriser les règles une à une,
ca se complique. Avec ce système, j'interdis (donc TRUNK=NotAllowed) la
destination 338 puis je n'ouvre que les routes 338x que je veux ;-)

When Making a call that is not answered, after timeout : no explanation,
just a busy tone/Hangup (voice prompt would be nice)

Callback : Allow/Deny pr user

Rates : it should be possible to enter rates in different currencies for
each ratecard.

I have 3 providers : a danish who list prices in DKK, a english who
lists prices in EUR, and a US who list prices in USD.

I think you can see my problem.

DID : answer with voice on unassigned did.


Needed DID improvement :
;played when receiving call on DID with no assigned destination
did_not_assigned_snd=

DOCUMENTATION

from your web site

cp -rf libs_a2billing /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/.
should be
cp -rf libs_a2billing/* /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/.
or u will miss 2 files in the folder

likewise from your website
cp  sounds/en/* /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/.
can be
cp  sounds/en/* /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/. < yes.txt
if u want to automate in a script

1) Your system has a term of credit and credit limit. In fact the field that
has name CREDIT in your system in official terms of professional billing
systems has name ACCOUNT BALANCE. So the right name for this field could be
BALANCE. This balance can be positive and negative. The field name CREDIT is
not so correct because positive condition of account is not credit in fact,
this is DEBIT account, the CREDIT takes a place only when the user has
negative condition of his account balance. Credit limit only shows the
amount of negative condition of account balance. In other cases talking
about credit is not right way because in fact it is not credit. This also
could be better if credit customer could hear in the voice the real state of
his account balance not just a sum of real payed money plus credit limit but
only the number in BALANCE(CREDIT in your version) field. Talking the sum of
money and credit limit don't give customers the real info if he has a debt
of not. If the customer has a debt most calling card platforms say "balance
of your account is minus blah blah blah".

beyond my means and ability to be able to modify the code to make a2billing
charge a fixed amount eg: 5cents per minute. for sip to sip calls... :(


#### []
********************************************************************
//// IMPORTANT 
Add new reporting

i also made little changes according to my poor understanding,  in call-log.php ( u sent me with billsec display)
$QUERY = "SELECT substring(calldate,1,10) AS day, sum(billsec) AS calltime, count(*) as nbcall FROM cdr WHERE disposition LIKE 'ANSWERED' AND ".$FG_TABLE_CLAUSE." GROUP BY substring(calldate,1,10)"; //extract(DAY from calldate)
replaced duration with billsec   to display billsec sum in bottom summery and to view correct ACT  i added  where disposion  like answered
cos ACD  =  can be calculated with answered calls    and i am also looking to add ASR formula in it


#### []
********************************************************************
//// IMPORTANT 
- and kindly  do add   the option to   take backup of rates tables  etc...
- and very important batch options  for all fields

Importing Rate Cards

To import rate cards, your cvs file has to be formatted in a specific
way.

1 Obtain your vendors rates in cvs.

2 Open it in your favorite spreadsheet or database editor.

3 Find and arrange the columns so that the first three are:
      dialprefix - dial prefix
      destination - country
      rate initial - how much you charge

4 Find any of the other fields in your file that have data such as:
      buyrate - how much you pay provider per minute
      buyrateinitblock - minimum time provider bills you
      buyrateincrement - billing time increment from provider
      initblock - minimum time your bill caller
      billingblock - billing time increment to caller
      connect charge  - connect charge to caller
      disconnect charge - disconnect charge to caller
(there are additional fields not listed here available as
well.)                          Once you have found them, I would
suggest renameing them
appropriately                           to lessen confusion.
You may also find some cvs files have the country and city code in
seperate fields, you going to have to append the latter to the first
and call it dialprefix.

5 Check that the field arrangement has the following order: dialprefix,
destination, rate initial
Additional fields can be in any order you like, but take note of the
order for later.

6 Preparing the file to import.
The file has to be cvs format. Comma seperated format, but we cant use
commas. The accepted characters are:
';'  ':'  '-'  '\t'
You must save the file using one of the above as the seperator.
On my mac, I used excel to edit the file and bbedit to find and replace
all ',' with ';' and save in the Unix Unicode UT8 format.
Your file should look like this:

dialprefix;destination;rate initial;buyrate;initblock
119370;afghanistan cellular;0.8135;0.3135;30
1193;afghanistan proper;0.7866;0.2866;30
1135538;albania cellular;0.7076;0.2076;30

7. Open the a2billing page in your browser. Find Import RateCard.
'Choose the ratecard to import', 'Choose the trunk to use'.
'Choose the additionnal field that you want to import from your cvs
file.'
Here you will add any additional fields you described in the file.
Select the field and use the right green arrow to bring over. Do this
for all fields you have in the file. Make sure they are in the order
you noted earler. Make any order adjustments by selecting and using the
red up/down arrows to move.

8 Once you are finished "Choose File" and then "Import RateCard". If
all is well
you will see all of your field headers match up. Once you confirm they
do, hit "Continue to Import the RateCard". (It may ask you to select
the file again)

9 You will then get a confirmation of how many rates were successfully
imported.

WIKI TO HAVE + SEVERAL A2B ON THE SAME BOX
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can program in a2billing.conf several configurations but only
to set different behaviour for the "agi" not for the rest of the
system.

Well in your case if you want to make coexist 2+ a2billing platforms
on the same box,
you will have to trick a little bit. There is a file call
Class.A2Billing.php in each components (web, agi, web-cust) and at the
beginning of it there is the definition to select the conf files

define('AST_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/asterisk/');
...
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR . '/a2billing.conf');


so you can create a new db
duplicate the web interface in other directory and all files for the agi and
for instance copy those last in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/

change the file
/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/libs_a2billing/Class.A2Billing.php

with for instance
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR .
'/a2billing.namecustomer.conf');

etc...

2) In most billing systems identification of customer is not associated with
PIN code. Most usual and flexible way is to add the term of account.  The
account has associated with it PIN codes, CLIDs and other methods of
providing services. For example you have a corporative customer that is
company with 15 employees. These all people use PIN codes, their cell phones
callerids also used for access. They just call and call but money for calls
everytime taken from ONE account and they don't have to think about their
personal account balance, the company has one account for all PINs and
CLIDs. This is usual practise for most billing systems. This
company-customer can get the report in any time and look how many calls were
made by employees and how much money they spent from the account and how
many money were spent by all employees instead of looking the personal
accounts of all employees.
