The VAT is not in the invoice


#### FEATURES
********************************************************************
User info Profile user can see any data for SIP registrations his device like sip-login an sip-password (locked to change) 




#### BUGS
********************************************************************
1. The notify user (send_reminder) when min_credit_2call is reached doesn't seem to work. I have made the changes in a2billing.conf but still no email is sent to user, how do i get this working?

2. Is it possible to have the reminder sent at a differnt value than the min_credit_2call? 


Reason for this is, I would like a reminder to be sent when a user has Â£x credit left in their account but the user should still be able to use the account with the current balance. At the moment the only way to achieve this is to set the min_credit_2call=0 (this way the user gets to use every penny in their account) but by this time i think the reminder that is being sent when credit=0 is too late.

http://forum.asterisk2billing.org/viewtopic.php?t=93&highlight=voicemail


You need to create the appropiated line for each extension at the voicemail.conf file. Add the following lines to your a2billing context to give your clients the voicemail feature:

Code:

[vmmain]
exten => *97,1,Answer
exten => *97,n,Wait(1)
exten => *97,n,VoiceMailMain(${CALLERID(num)}@default)
exten => *97,n,Hangup 




#### SIGNUP SELECT TARIFFGROUP
********************************************************************
; ID Tariffgroup to use, check the ID in the tariffgroup list - WebUI
tariff = 1

need to be changed to

; ID Tariffgroup to sign the customers
; or define a list of ID to let himselect select the tariffgroup
; check the ID in the tariffgroup list - WebUI
tariff = 1, 2, 3

So in case of multiple tariff, a new Dropdown menu will appear on the signup form.
with the list of tariff group defined here 
(name of the tariff group will appear, not the number 1, 2, 3)

Security, ensure at the sign-up time that the value send by the form is include in
it to avoid the possibility from the customer to signup under an other tariffgroup

#### BUG : DID BILLING
********************************************************************
bug DID billing
we create a DID with no monthly cost for instance free or just dialout cost!!
When the use take the DID from the customer interface, it still have to pay for it
we dont check the billingtype of DID


#### BUG : DID  (not urgent)
********************************************************************
I Create a Card when I dont have  any DID Group
and I Simply Go and Create DID Group
and Create a Destination and Bind it with a Card
Go to the Client Side You will see the Destination in the Card
but when you will go to edit the Destination you will see the DIDGroup List is Not Loaded

#### GENERAL CHANGE IN CUSTOMER SIDE
********************************************************************
- to remove the all the page used for pdf export like : A2B_entity_unbilled_summary1.php
  we should be able to deal with A2B_entity_unbilled_summary.php only and add a parameter mode for the pdf export.


#### CONSOLIDATE THE GETTEXT FILES
********************************************************************
Consolidate the gettext files for customer and admin interface
regenerate all PO & MO files


######## CREDIT RESERVE - SIMULTANEOUS ACCESS
********************************************************************

Wouldn't this mean on simultaneous access, callers could go negative in balance if subsequent calls were made while balance still exists?
http://forum.a2billing.net/viewtopic.php?t=1759&highlight=


Does the same account allow for simultaneous calls?
Yes. Here's how it works: Say you have a balance of ten (10) dollars. When your first call comes in, two hours worth of credit is temporarily frozen. So, if you are calling a destination that costs 2 cents a minute, that means $2.40 (2 cents/min x 120 minutes) has been frozen in your account. This leaves $7.60 available for another simultaneous call. When that second call comes in, more of your balance is frozen. You can keep making simultaneous calls so long as your effective balance is above zero. When calls are completed, the balance that was frozen is released and once again available for use. If you have a low balance, there's no sense in letting many simultaneous calls go through, only to have them all disconnect at the same time when your balance hits zero (what most carriers do).




######## DID RANGE 
********************************************************************
Add the same feature that is used on CID to add a new callerID
support range and coma



######## NOTE FROM CHRISTEAS : BACKUP DB
********************************************************************
giving apache the right to dump stuff is bad, IMHO.
So, you could have a crontab task backing up the database. 
That task could use a 'a2billing' system user, with the rights to connect to the database.


#### DIVERS
********************************************************************
Add new tables for reseller and callshop


#### FEATURE : NEW CALLBACK SYSTEM
********************************************************************
rebuild of the callback system, we are using a spool system in DB and a perl Daemon to initiate the callback.
it brings flexibility and a way to track the callback request, their status, etc...
So we have a spool system, all request are stored and handled by a perl daemon that will take care of dispatching 
them through several asterisk server.
There is also an API also for this to generate the callback.
/api/api_spool_callback.php
this could be use by any third application/platform to generate callback request.


#### FEATURE : OPTIMIZE AGI TO USE PL/SQL functions for all important functions
******************************************************************************
... not for now


#### FEATURE : ADD RANGE CARDNUMBER IN CARDGENERATOR
********************************************************************
let's the user define a range of cardnumber (ie: 45000-46000)
+ option to check if there is a cards already between this range (interval limit 10000)


#### FEATURE : SIGN-UP for tracking...
********************************************************************
working out the source of a signup so that comission can be paid. 
a link to the signup be created that enters the source of the link against 
the customer, e.g. an agent name or website address?


#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
BATCH GENERATION OF INVOICE
need a feature that can allow admin to generate the invoice for all the postpaid or 
prepaid account with just one click.
right now, we have to go to Call Report/Invoice, and then select the respective month, 
and then select the card one by one, and then save the html page. And doing that 
repetitively for 100 cards is quite gruesome 
so auto generate invoice (with criteria) and maybe auto mailing, that will be cool



#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
thoughts to adding timezone to cc_card ? It's great that we've got language and currency so they can view items in their local currency. Why not have option for timezone so the CDR's are listed in their local times instead of where the switch is located?
I borrowed this idea from SER. I can get you their database table they use if you like. It makes it easy for user instead of asking for +/- GMT, has items such as:


#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
Marcel

- invoices: keep an end of the month balance and send automatically invoices at the end of the month using an email template and attaching a html invoice report; fields in the template would include name, last month balance, current month payments, current month per minute charges, DIDs and other charges, etc.

- payment: send payment emails to customers when "Add Payment" is used; send an email out of a template saying something like "thank you for payment of XXX made on YYYY...."; maybe the ability to display the payment history on the customer web site to see if they paid the bill or not 

"Add Payment" do not refill the account, you have to do refill manually.
- Adding a feature there to make an auto refill

#### NOTE
********************************************************************
Note to areski â should we be able to define international access prefixes? 00 UK & Europe, 
011 USA , but 0099 for South Africa. See http://kropla.com/dialcode.htm IDD column

Note to Areski â why have free as an option, surely if I wanted free, I would set fixrate to 0?



********************************************************************
To tidy up the box for filtering, can you either reduce the font size or use symbols only, e.g. >  ;   >=  ; <=


	
#### NEW TASK []
********************************************************************
Yep - having a separate figure for VAT would be useful
for VAT returns
however - UK VAT laws say that if a call originates outside of the EU, then no VAT is required on the call
however if a call starts within the EU, the VAT is payable

 





#### NEW TASK []
********************************************************************
Card company can set default language and customer can change 1. English 2. Dutch, 3. French
etc.
make it more easily customizable



#### NEW TASK []

#### NEW TASK - NEW button style []
********************************************************************
New button for edit/delete... really tiny but with text
New button for confirm Data


#### BUG []
********************************************************************

	Line 382 in a2billing.php has:
					   if (substr($A2B->CallerID,0,1)=='0'){
						   $A2B ->dnid = $A2B ->destination =
	$caller_areacode.substr($A2B->CallerID,1);
					   }else{
						   $A2B ->dnid = $A2B ->destination =
	$caller_areacode.$A2B->CallerID;
					   }
					   $agi->verbose('line:'.__LINE__.' - '.'[destination:
	- '.$A2B->destination.']');
	
	[a2billing-cid-callback]
	exten => _X.,1,DeadAGI(a2billing.php|1|cid-callback|34) ;last
	parameter is the callback area code
	exten => _X.,2,Hangup
	
	As u see the last parameter is the area code and from instance :
	if I am in Belgium and use a local DID for callback but my server are
	in UK, the system will probably not know that it needs to call me back
	over the prefix 32, that's why is needed.
	So in this case my cell number 0473510969, a2b will be call me as 32473510969.
	That s the meaning of the remaining zero and it makes sense to set a parameter 
	for the leading zero if you are
	already in the local country.

********************************************************************
Improve invoices system : let us store the generate invoice on the

#### []
********************************************************************
Suggestion from Vahan
	1. First of all I'd suggest to introduce one single yet simple config
	option in a2billing.conf: silent=yes|no that allows to turn off all the
	voice prompts in the case a2billing.php has successfully authenticated
	the caller-id/card number and if the assosiated card number has enough
	credit. Currently you have to disable several announce configs for this.

	2. add an option to filter by first name / last name too in the card picker.

	3. Please first name to the list to as a separate column or merged with
	last name. It's difficult to track people by their lastnames only.
	Areski : I propose more to get rid of lastname and include a new feature to 
	roll over the row and get more info. it will keep up a clear design

e.) at the form of adding/changing SIP/IAX user there should be a possibilty to erase some parameters. like if there isn't any entry (example in canreinvite) that this also don't will be printed to the sip-config.

********************************************************************

d) different SIP/IAX files for each administrator/account- so with this there would be a possibility for a better differnece of two persons which handle the system and don't overwrite any manual config or/and a better usefull possibility for special definitions for the caller if he want to change like the "callerid" or anything else

5.) BUG : if the debug level in /etc/asterisk/a2billing.conf will be activated to 1, 2 or 3 there sould be a DEBUG from the AGI-scripts to the log_file. But I've seen, that many debugging information will not be printed to the logfile.
 
So the statments "if ($A2B->agiconfig['debug']>=1) " don't work even the debug is set (i printed out the debug and I've seen it that the entry is correct. Maybe there is a mistake in the $agi->verbose but I don't looked there because it isn't so urgent to fix it.
 
Here is a example (the first line is from me and will printed out, the $A2B->agiconfig['debug'] = 2 but the two verbose don't will be printed to the log_file) :
 
# diff /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/a2billing.php
122c124
                                        $A2B -> write_log("[CREDIT STATUS : ".$A2B-> credit."]");
                                        if ($A2B->agiconfig['debug']>=1) $agi->verbose("[CREDIT STATUS : ".$A2B-> credit."]");
                                        if ($A2B->agiconfig['debug']>=1) $agi->verbose("[CREDIT MIN_CREDIT_2CALL : ".$A2B->agiconfig['min_credit_2call']."]");

Petite question: je suis entrain de mettre en place des routes et ai
trouvÃ© un truc que tu pourrais incorporer d'origine: un TRUNK nommÃ©
NotAllowed (exemple), ProvideIP=NoProvider. Dans les scripts, lorsque tu
rencontres ce peer, soit tu ne fais rien et envois le message - le
numÃ©ro composÃ© n'est pas disponible - ce qui est le cas actuellement
parceque * ne trouve pas ce host et renvoit un code erreur a A2Billing,
soit tu permets d'appeller une extension de type 100@default ou
Local/default/200 ou ... qui permettrait de personnaliser l'annonce/le
traitement.

Pourquoi je pense Ã  ca? Prenons la FR comme ex: les routes vers les
numÃ©ros 8xx. sont compliquÃ©es: soit c'est gratuit (Freebox et consors)
soit c'est ultra-payant :-( Si je dois autoriser les rÃ¨gles une Ã  une,
ca se complique. Avec ce systÃ¨me, j'interdis (donc TRUNK=NotAllowed) la
destination 338 puis je n'ouvre que les routes 338x que je veux ;-)

When Making a call that is not answered, after timeout : no explanation,

Rates : it should be possible to enter rates in different currencies for
each ratecard.

I have 3 providers : a danish who list prices in DKK, a english who
lists prices in EUR, and a US who list prices in USD.

I think you can see my problem.

#### [Update-local-text-files]
********************************************************************

DOCUMENTATION

from your web site

cp -rf libs_a2billing/* /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/.

if u want to automate in a script

 
------------

1) Your system has a term of credit and credit limit. In fact the field that
has name CREDIT in your system in official terms of professional billing
systems has name ACCOUNT BALANCE. So the right name for this field could be
BALANCE. This balance can be positive and negative. The field name CREDIT is
not so correct because positive condition of account is not credit in fact,
this is DEBIT account, the CREDIT takes a place only when the user has
negative condition of his account balance. Credit limit only shows the
amount of negative condition of account balance. In other cases talking
about credit is not right way because in fact it is not credit. This also
could be better if credit customer could hear in the voice the real state of
his account balance not just a sum of real payed money plus credit limit but
only the number in BALANCE(CREDIT in your version) field. Talking the sum of
money and credit limit don't give customers the real info if he has a debt
of not. If the customer has a debt most calling card platforms say "balance
of your account is minus blah blah blah".

Importing Rate Cards

To import rate cards, your cvs file has to be formatted in a specific
way.

1 Obtain your vendors rates in cvs.

2 Open it in your favorite spreadsheet or database editor.

3 Find and arrange the columns so that the first three are:
      dialprefix - dial prefix
      destination - country
      rate initial - how much you charge

4 Find any of the other fields in your file that have data such as:
      buyrate - how much you pay provider per minute
      buyrateinitblock - minimum time provider bills you
      buyrateincrement - billing time increment from provider
      initblock - minimum time your bill caller
      billingblock - billing time increment to caller
      connect charge  - connect charge to caller
      disconnect charge - disconnect charge to caller
(there are additional fields not listed here available as
well.)                          Once you have found them, I would
suggest renameing them
appropriately                           to lessen confusion.
You may also find some cvs files have the country and city code in
seperate fields, you going to have to append the latter to the first
and call it dialprefix.

5 Check that the field arrangement has the following order: dialprefix,
destination, rate initial
Additional fields can be in any order you like, but take note of the
order for later.

6 Preparing the file to import.
The file has to be cvs format. Comma seperated format, but we cant use
commas. The accepted characters are:
';'  ':'  '-'  '\t'
You must save the file using one of the above as the seperator.
On my mac, I used excel to edit the file and bbedit to find and replace
all ',' with ';' and save in the Unix Unicode UT8 format.
Your file should look like this:

dialprefix;destination;rate initial;buyrate;initblock
119370;afghanistan cellular;0.8135;0.3135;30
1193;afghanistan proper;0.7866;0.2866;30
1135538;albania cellular;0.7076;0.2076;30

7. Open the a2billing page in your browser. Find Import RateCard.
'Choose the ratecard to import', 'Choose the trunk to use'.
'Choose the additionnal field that you want to import from your cvs
file.'
Here you will add any additional fields you described in the file.
Select the field and use the right green arrow to bring over. Do this
for all fields you have in the file. Make sure they are in the order
you noted earler. Make any order adjustments by selecting and using the
red up/down arrows to move.

8 Once you are finished "Choose File" and then "Import RateCard". If
all is well
you will see all of your field headers match up. Once you confirm they
do, hit "Continue to Import the RateCard". (It may ask you to select
the file again)

9 You will then get a confirmation of how many rates were successfully
imported.

WIKI TO HAVE + SEVERAL A2B ON THE SAME BOX
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can program in a2billing.conf several configurations but only
to set different behaviour for the "agi" not for the rest of the
system.

Well in your case if you want to make coexist 2+ a2billing platforms
on the same box,
you will have to trick a little bit. There is a file call
Class.A2Billing.php in each components (web, agi, web-cust) and at the
beginning of it there is the definition to select the conf files

define('AST_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/asterisk/');
...
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR . '/a2billing.conf');


so you can create a new db
duplicate the web interface in other directory and all files for the agi and
for instance copy those last in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/

change the file
/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/libs_a2billing/Class.A2Billing.php

with for instance
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR .
'/a2billing.namecustomer.conf');

etc...

2) In most billing systems identification of customer is not associated with
PIN code. Most usual and flexible way is to add the term of account.  The
account has associated with it PIN codes, CLIDs and other methods of
providing services. For example you have a corporative customer that is
company with 15 employees. These all people use PIN codes, their cell phones
callerids also used for access. They just call and call but money for calls
everytime taken from ONE account and they don't have to think about their
personal account balance, the company has one account for all PINs and
CLIDs. This is usual practise for most billing systems. This
company-customer can get the report in any time and look how many calls were
made by employees and how much money they spent from the account and how
many money were spent by all employees instead of looking the personal
accounts of all employees.
